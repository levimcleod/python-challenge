# Description
**PyBank:**
PyBank is a Python script that takes budget data in the form of "Date" and "Profit/Losses" from a .CVS file and makes the following calculations:
-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The average of changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

**PyPoll:**
PyPoll is a Python script that takes election data in the form of "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate" from a .CVS file and makes the following calculations:
-The total number of votes cast
-A complete list of candidates who received votes
-The percentage of votes each candidate won
-The total number of votes each candidate won
-The winner of the election based on popular vote

Both PyBank and PyPoll will print the analysis in the console output and generate a .TXT file with a copy of the analysis to the 'Analysis' folder.
